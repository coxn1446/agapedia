# Assets Directory

This directory should contain:

1. **Logo-white-background.png** - Your custom logo for the wiki header
2. **Camp-Aerial-Shot.jpg** - Background image for the wiki pages

## Adding Files

1. Place your logo file here as `Logo-white-background.png`
2. Place your background image here as `Camp-Aerial-Shot.jpg`

The CampBackground extension will automatically use these files once they are added.
